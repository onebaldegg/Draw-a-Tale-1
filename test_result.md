# Test Results

## Backend

- task: "DELETE endpoint for drawings"
  implemented: true
  working: true
  file: "/app/backend/server.py"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history:
    - working: "NA"
      agent: "main"
      comment: "DELETE endpoint for drawings has been implemented but needs testing"
    - working: true
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "DELETE endpoint for drawings is working correctly. It properly deletes drawings, requires authentication, and returns appropriate error messages. The only minor issue is that unauthenticated requests return 403 instead of 401, but this is consistent with FastAPI's HTTPBearer behavior."

## Frontend

- task: "Gallery page delete functionality"
  implemented: true
  working: true
  file: "/app/frontend/src/components/Gallery.js"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history:
    - working: "NA"
      agent: "main"
      comment: "Delete button in Gallery page is implemented but was getting 405 errors"
    - working: true
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "Delete functionality in Gallery page is now working correctly. The delete button shows a confirmation modal, and upon confirmation, it successfully sends a DELETE request to the backend API and removes the drawing from the gallery. No 405 errors were observed."

- task: "Dashboard card titles font"
  implemented: true
  working: true
  file: "/app/frontend/src/App.css"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "medium"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history:
    - working: true
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "Dashboard card titles are correctly using the 'Indie Flower' handwriting font as specified in App.css. The font is properly applied to all three dashboard cards ('Start Drawing', 'My Gallery', 'Quest Map')."
