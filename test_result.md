      comment: "DELETE endpoint for drawings has been implemented but needs testing"
    - working: true
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "DELETE endpoint for drawings is working correctly. It properly deletes drawings, requires authentication, and returns appropriate error messages. The only minor issue is that unauthenticated requests return 403 instead of 401, but this is consistent with FastAPI's HTTPBearer behavior."
