# Draw-a-Tale-1
a program to teach children to draw through story telling.

To create the most engaging, supportive, and inspiring educational drawing application in the world, empowering children of all neurological profiles to build artistic skills and creative confidence.

Many children, especially those who are neurodivergent, lack access to art education that is both pedagogically sound and adapted to their unique needs. Existing drawing apps are often either unstructured digital toys or rigid instructional tools with overstimulating interfaces. They lack a deep, scaffolded curriculum and fail to leverage AI as a truly collaborative and personalized partner.

Draw-a-Tale is the only drawing app that combines a comprehensive, scaffolded, gamified art curriculum with a collaborative AI storyteller and a neuro-inclusive design philosophy, creating a uniquely personalized and empowering creative journey.
